<body>

<p>The <b>KDX Collection Generator</b> application is a command line
and graphical user interface tool for generating Kindle book collections
from a directory tree containing e-books. The collection names reflect
multi-level organisation, as they are generated according to the
directory tree. This program has only been tested using GNU/Linux, and
Mac OSX.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Connect your Kindle to this computer. If the device is not
	detected automatically, mount your Kindle manually.</li>
	<li>Select the Kindle device by click on the '<tt>Open Kindle</tt>'
	button.</li>
	<li>Opening a Kindle device automatically generates the collection by
	reading the contents of the <tt>documents</tt> sub-directory. If this
	was successful, a collection browser will replace this help message.</li>
	<li>Saving the collection:<br>
	<ul>
		<li>Click '<tt>Save to Kindle</tt>' button to save the collection
		directly to the Kindle device. This will first backup existing
		collections.</li>
		<li>Click '<tt>Save as file</tt>' button to save the collection
		to a file of your choosing.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

this package.</p>
