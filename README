  I. INTRODUCTION
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The program kdxgen is a command line tool for generating Kindle book
collections from a directory tree containing e-books. The collection
names reflect multi-level organisation, as they are generated according
to the directory tree. This program has only been tested using GNU/Linux.

I started writing this program for personal use. I have seen GUI based
applications, such as Calibre (http://calibre-ebook.com/) and Kindle*
Collection Manager (http://www.colegate.net/KindleCollectionManager/),
however I could not use them. The later is only available for Windows+
systems; whereas, the former is more general purpose (and less suitable
for my needs). I organise my e-books using a directory tree, and hence,
I prefer a command line tool.

I hope that you will also enjoy using the tool, and find it useful.

 II. FEATURES
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Generate collections automatically from the directory tree.
    * Multi-level directory tree for better document organisation.
    * No need to maintain collections directly from device.



III. USAGE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 $ java -jar kdxgen.jar [OPTIONS]
 
 -d <arg>   Path to documents root. This must point to the root directory,
            where all of the ebooks are stored. Furthermore, because of
            the KDX hashing requirement, this path must point to a
            directory named 'documents'.
            
 -l <arg>   The maximum number of characters allowed as collection names.
            If the generated collection name is longer than the permitted,
            it will be shortened to fit within the specified length. By
            default, this value is set to 48 characters.
            
 -o <arg>   Send result to output file. If unspecified, result will be
            sent to standard output (stdout).
            
 -v         Display log information on console. By default, log
            information is directed to '/tmp/kdxgen.log' file only.



 IV. EXAMPLE
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To illustrate usage, consider this directory structure at KDX mount point

/mnt/kdx
        |____audible
        |____music
        |____system
        |____documents
                 |_______Alpha Fruits
                           |_______apple.pdf
                           |_______mango.azw
                           |_______orange.azw
                 |_______Beta Animals
                           |_______zebra.pdf
                           |_______rhino.pdf
                 |_______Gamma Fish Big and Small      
                           |_______dolphin.azw
                           |_______whale.pdf
                           |_______Delta Fish Small
                                     |_______lobster.azw
                                     |_______seahorse.pdf


Running kdxgen, as shown below will produce a collections.json.

 $ cd /mnt/kdx/system
 $ mv collections.json collections.json.old
 $ java -jar kdxgen.jar -d /mnt/kdx/documents -o collections.json

  ______________________________________________________________________
 |                                                                      |
 | WARNING     WARNING     WARNING     WARNING     WARNING     WARNING  |   
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------|
 | Please save your existing collections.json before running kdxgen as  |
 | shown below; otherwise, the current collections will be lost.       |
 |______________________________________________________________________|
 
 
The collections.json file should go inside the 'system' directory (see above).
Once loaded, restart the KDX (see Kindle* DX documentation). This could take
a while, depending on the size of the collection. Once everything is loaded,
the collections at the KDX 'home' should look like this:

/documents/Alpha Fruits
    apple.pdf
    mango.azw
    orange.azw
/documents/Beta Animals
    zebra.pdf
    rhino.pdf
/documents/Gamma Fish Big and Small
    dolphin.azw
    whale.pdf
/documents/Gamma Fish Big and Small/Delta Fish Small
    lobster.azw
    seahorse.pdf


If the collection name is too long (default value is 48 characters), the
collection name will be shortened. For example, if we assume that the
maximum length is 30 characters, the following collection will be produced
instead of the previous.

/documents/Alpha Fruits
    apple.pdf
    mango.azw
    orange.azw
/documents/Beta Animals
    zebra.pdf
    rhino.pdf
/documents/Gamma Fish Big ...
    dolphin.azw
    whale.pdf
    lobster.azw
    seahorse.pdf
